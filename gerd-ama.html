      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Q1: What exactly is the Abay GERD Token?</h2>

    <section class="mb-6">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Q2: Who can claim GERD tokens?</h2>
      <p>Anyone, anywhere! Special priority is given to users in Ethiopia. Originally, users could claim 1,000 GERD globally or 7,500 in Ethiopia ‚Äî later increased to 10,000 and 75,000 respectively.</p>

<br>
    <section class="mb-6">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Q3: How many tokens exist, and how are they distributed?</h2>
      <p>Total supply is <strong>120 billion GERD</strong> tokens. 115B are locked in a smart contract with 1B released annually over 115 years. The remaining 5B are used for <strong>distribution, liquidity, rewards, and development</strong>.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Q4: What ensures fairness and transparency?</h2>
      <p>All token flows are verifiable on the blockchain. Governance is via a <strong>3-of-5 Gnosis Safe multisig</strong>. Smart contracts are <strong>immutable</strong> and open-source - public, verifiable on GitHub and Binance Smart Chain.</p>

    <section class="mb-6">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Q5: How does the vesting system work?</h2>
      <p>Each year, 1B tokens are released and distributed as:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
        <li>500M to airdrops</li>
        <li>250M to staking</li>
        <li>250M to liquidity (or burned if pool is full)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Trackable via our public <strong>vesting dashboard</strong>.</p>
    </section>
<br>
    <section class="mb-6">
  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Q6: What platforms support GERD Token?</h2>
  <p><strong>GERD Token is currently deployed on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC)</strong>, chosen for its low transaction fees and widespread wallet compatibility.</p>

  
  <p class="mt-4"><strong>Ethereum Network Readiness (if ever needed)</strong><br>
   While there are <strong>no current plans to migrate to Ethereum</strong>, GERD Token is technically prepared in case the community ever decides a migration is necessary in the future. Wallet addresses on BSC and Ethereum are identical due to shared key derivation, so holders would automatically receive their migrated tokens on Ethereum ‚Äî simply by importing the new ETH contract address into their existing wallet.</p>
  <p>This provides:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
    <li>A seamless option for future cross-chain support if ever required</li>
    <li>Zero friction for token holders in case of migration</li>
    <li>Community flexibility and future-proof design</li>
  </ul>

    <section class="mb-6">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Q9: Can users trust the claim process?</h2>

<br>
    <section class="mb-6">
  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Q10: What‚Äôs the long-term vision?</h2>
  <p>We aim to <strong>digitize the unbanked community finance</strong> and build a <strong>sustainable, community-powered economy</strong>. GERD Token is designed to last 115 years ‚Äî with every step fully decentralized, auditable, and fair.</p>
  <p class="mt-4">Our broader goal is <strong>digital value creation within the GERD community</strong>, especially for the unbanked population who already have the most important tools: <strong>internet access and a mobile device</strong>. By lowering the barriers to entry, we are creating a system where anyone can participate, own, and benefit from a decentralized digital future.</p>
