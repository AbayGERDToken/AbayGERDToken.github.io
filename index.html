<h2 class="title">Abstract</h2>
<p>Abay GERD Token (GERD) is a decentralized cryptocurrency initiative inspired by Ethiopia's 
  monumental Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) and the Abay (Nile) River, the 
  lifeline of the region. The project is designed for the global community, but it especially 
  favors users in Ethiopia as a tribute to the source of the Abay River and the home of the 
  GERD.</p><br/>
<p>Unlike many crypto projects designed to benefit a privileged few through presales or seed 
  rounds, GERD is by the people, for the people. We intentionally 
  avoid private sales, venture capital allocations, or seed investors making this a uniquely people-powered initiative. </p><br/>
  Inspired by the symbolic unity and ambition of the GERD project, GERD Token embodies 
the resilience, pride, and potential of the Ethiopian people, while inviting the world to 
participate in a fair and open digital economy.</p><br>

  <p>With a total supply of 120 billion tokens, the project is built on fairness, transparency, and 
community empowerment. The smart contract source code is available on GitHub and 
fully viewable on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring complete transparency and 
open-source verifiability.</p><br>
         
        <p>We welcome your thoughts on enhancing the adoption of our token, particularly among our unbanked communities who, despite having access to smartphones
        and internet connections, have been largely overlooked in the digital economy. Please share your ideas on how we can better reach out to these 
        communities, empowering them to take advantage of and claim their free tokens.</p><br/>

<h2 class="title">Special Token Distribution - Honoring The Pioneers of GERD</h2>
<p>The construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) was a monumental project and a testament to Ethiopian ingenuity and 
        determination. We would like to acknowledge and honor the individuals who played a pivotal role in turning this dream into reality. 
        Their unwavering commitment and dedication serve as an inspiration to us all.<br/><br/>

        In recognition of the extraordinary contributions made by certain dignitaries to the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), we are 
        honored to grant a symbolic token of appreciation, in the form of 1 million Abay GERD tokens, to each of these individuals.<br/><br/>
        
        These tokens are not deducted from the 115 billion tokens reserved for the 115 million Ethiopians. Instead, they will be
         allocated from the separate pool of tokens set aside for future development. This gesture is a testament to our deep gratitude 
         for their invaluable contributions, their unwavering commitment, and the indelible marks they have made on this monumental
          project. Their dedication and the impact they've had will forever be a significant part of Ethiopia's history.<br/><br/>
        
        Our first honoree is the late Engineer Simegnew Bekele. As the Chief Project Manager of GERD, his tireless efforts and dedication
         played a critical role in the progress of this ambitious undertaking. Despite the many challenges that came his way,
          Engineer Simegnew stood firm in his conviction, inspiring those around him with his unwavering commitment and enthusiasm.
           His untimely departure was a great loss to the nation, but his legacy continues to inspire us and future generations.<br/><br/>
        
        We are privileged to present this token of appreciation posthumously to Engineer Simegnew Bekele, a true Ethiopian hero.
         The grant of 1 million Abay GERD Tokens is a humble gesture of recognition for his immense contribution to the GERD and the
          country. These tokens will remain reserved under <a href="https://bscscan.com/token/0x660941bb4AA9FcBED00375673D21088A9d0C5019?a=0x75F5f7d68AD14f467c935d6B375D350614F9cF68" target="_blank"> 
            0x75F5f7d68AD14f467c935d6B375D350614F9cF68 </a> until his rightful heirs come forward to claim them.<br/><br/>

            Our second honoree is the late Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, a visionary leader whose passion and steadfast belief in the future of
             Ethiopia were instrumental in initiating the GERD project. His leadership was critical in laying the groundwork for this national
              endeavor, and his forward-thinking policies inspired the nation to dream big. Meles Zenawi’s dedication to the GERD project ensured 
              that his name would forever be intertwined with the dam’s legacy.<br/><br/>

              We are privileged to present this token of appreciation posthumously to Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, a true Ethiopian hero.

        Stay tuned as we continue to recognize and honor more individuals who have made significant contributions to the GERD 
        project. Their dedication and the indelible marks they have made on this project will be forever inscribed in the
         fabric of Ethiopian history.</p>

      <h2 class="title">Forward Looking Statement</h2>
      <p>The Abay GERD Token project is a significant step towards creating a digital economy in Ethiopia, inspired by the unity and progress symbolized
               by the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. With a fair distribution system and a wide range of use cases, the Abay GERD Token aims to empower
                the Ethiopian people and contribute to the country’s growth and prosperity.</p><br/>
      <p>The GERD token, at the moment, does not have a monetary value attached to it in terms of traditional currencies like the dollar. This is
               because its true worth isn't calculated in dollars and cents, but in the shared ownership and sense of unity it fosters among Ethiopians.
              The value of the GERD token is intrinsically linked to the shared ownership of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam and the benefits it
               brings to Ethiopia and its people. As these tokens are evenly distributed among the Ethiopian population, they represent an equitable
                stake in this national project.</p><br/>
      <p>But the true potential of these tokens goes beyond immediate financial gain. The GERD tokens have the capacity to hold generational
                   value. They are not just tokens for today; they're tokens for our children and our children's children. They represent a 
                   share in Ethiopia's progress and prosperity, which will continue to grow and develop over time.</p><br/>
      <p>In the future, as the GERD project progresses and yields more benefits, the value of the tokens may increase, reflecting the 
                  growing prosperity of Ethiopia. Therefore, while these tokens may not have a direct dollar value now, they hold a promise of 
                  shared wealth and progress for all Ethiopians, now and in the generations to come.</p><br/>
      
      <p>Abay GERD Token is more than a crypto project—it’s a movement rooted in transparency, 
        community empowerment, and community pride. Through a sustainable release model 
        and fair global participation, it aims to shape a future as monumental as the dam it was 
        inspired by. </p><br>
        <p><strong>Token claims are ongoing. Join the movement today!</strong></p><br>
        <p>The Abay GERD Token project team encourages all participants to claim their share of tokens for free while participating
          in the token distribution process.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <h2 class="title">Centralized Exchange Listing Roadmap</h2>
        <p>As part of our long-term vision for broader accessibility and liquidity, Abay GERD Token aims to pursue listing on a 
          centralized exchange (CEX) once we reach a milestone of 100,000 unique wallet holders. This milestone reflects strong 
          community adoption and grassroots support—key pillars of our people-powered mission. A CEX listing will enable easier
           access to trading for users globally, enhance credibility, and introduce GERD Token to a wider audience. We believe 
           this approach balances organic growth with strategic expansion, ensuring that the listing benefits a robust and active
            holder base.</p>

<h2 class="title">Fun Fact:</h2>
<p>Laszlo Hanyecz was a computer programmer from Florida who made history for making the first documented purchase of a physical
         item using Bitcoin. On May 22, 2010, Hanyecz offered to pay 10,000 Bitcoins for two pizzas on the BitcoinTalk forum. The value
          of 10,000 Bitcoins at that time was roughly $41. A forum user in the UK agreed to take up the offer and ordered two pizzas
           from Papa John's for Hanyecz in exchange for the 10,000 Bitcoins. These two pizzas have gone down in history as likely being 
           the most expensive pizzas ever bought.<br/><br/>
        The day is now commemorated annually as "Bitcoin Pizza Day". It's an event that's held in high regard within the cryptocurrency 
        community, as it was a milestone that helped to legitimize Bitcoin as a means of payment. At the same time, it's also a stark 
        reminder of Bitcoin's incredible price appreciation over a relatively short period of time.<br/><br/>
        As of May 2023, the value of those 10,000 Bitcoins would be well over $250 million dollars, assuming Bitcoin's price is 
        roughly around $25,000 per coin.</p>
