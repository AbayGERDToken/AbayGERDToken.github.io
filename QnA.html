          <h2 class="subtitle">üîπ Why do Ethiopia originated wallets receive 75,000 GERD while others get 10,000 GERD tokens?</h2>
          <p>The Abay GERD Token was created as a tribute to the people of Ethiopia who collectively funded and built the Grand Renaissance
            Dam without external aid. This project represents unity, self-determination, and national pride. As such, Ethiopia is at the 
            heart of this initiative and receive the highest reward.</p>

        <div class="container">
          <h2 class="subtitle">üîπ Why does the rest of the world receive 10,000 GERD?</h2>
          <p>Global participants are essential to the success of any decentralized project. We welcome and appreciate your support. The 10,000 GERD reward 
            reflects both inclusivity and our commitment to keeping the token‚Äôs value sustainable while prioritizing communities most directly connected
             to the project‚Äôs origin.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="subtitle">üîπ Isn‚Äôt this unfair or discriminatory?</h2>
      <p>
        Not at all. This is mission-aligned distribution, not exclusion. Every user, regardless of region or background, is eligible to receive 
        tokens and participate freely. The distribution structure ensures that those who contributed to building the foundation‚Äîincluding the
         unbanked and less privileged individuals who played a vital role in constructing the dam‚Äîare recognized and empowered in proportion 
         to their efforts. The goal is not only fairness, but also long-term value creation for the communities that made this project possible.

    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="subtitle">üîπ Will I still be able to trade or earn more GERD tokens?</h2>
      <p>Yes. GERD tokens will remain tradable for all users worldwide. Once 100,000 wallets have successfully claimed tokens and the token is 
        listed on a centralized exchange (CEX), users will also be eligible to participate in future rewards, airdrops, and community-driven initiatives.</p>
