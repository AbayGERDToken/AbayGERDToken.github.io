      <h2 class="title">üìò QnA: Why Are Token Rewards Different by Region?</h2>
    </div>
    <br>

    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="subtitle">üîπ Why do Ethiopia originated wallets receive 75,000 GERD while others get 10,000 GERD tokens?</h2>
      <p>The Abay GERD Token was created as a tribute to the people of Ethiopia who collectively funded and built the Grand Renaissance
        Dam without external aid. This project represents unity, self-determination, and national pride. As such, Ethiopia is at the 
        heart of this initiative and receive the highest reward.</p>
    </div>

    <br><br>

    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="subtitle">üîπ Why does the rest of the world receive 10,000 GERD?</h2>
      <p>Global participants are essential to the success of any decentralized project. We welcome and appreciate your support. The 10,000 GERD reward 
        reflects both inclusivity and our commitment to keeping the token‚Äôs value sustainable while prioritizing communities most directly connected
        to the project‚Äôs origin.</p>
    </div>

    <br><br>

    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="subtitle">üîπ Isn‚Äôt this unfair or discriminatory?</h2>
      <p>
        Not at all. This is mission-aligned distribution, not exclusion. Every user, regardless of region or background, is eligible to receive 
        tokens and participate freely. The distribution structure ensures that those who contributed to building the foundation‚Äîincluding the
        unbanked and less privileged individuals who played a vital role in constructing the dam‚Äîare recognized and empowered in proportion 
        to their efforts. The goal is not only fairness, but also long-term value creation for the communities that made this project possible.
      </p>
    </div>

    <br><br>

    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="subtitle">üîπ Will I still be able to trade or earn more GERD tokens?</h2>
      <p>Yes. GERD tokens will remain tradable for all users worldwide. Once 10,000 wallets have successfully claimed tokens and the token is 
        listed on a centralized exchange (CEX), users will also be eligible to participate in future rewards, airdrops, and community-driven initiatives.</p>

      <h2 class="title">üìò QnA: Understanding Vesting in Simple Terms</h2>
    </div>
    <br>

    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="subtitle">üîπ What is ‚Äúvesting‚Äù and why should I care?</h2>
      <p>Vesting is a way to release tokens in small, scheduled portions over time instead of giving them all out at once. For the GERD Token, vesting means exactly <strong>1 billion tokens</strong will be released every year for the next <strong>115 years</strong>. This creates long-term stability and prevents anyone from dumping a huge amount of tokens on the market, which could hurt the value. It also rewards committed community members who stick around.</p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="subtitle">üîπ Who controls the tokens right now?</h2>
      <p>As of now, <strong>115 billion GERD tokens</strong> are still in a wallet controlled by a single human. They are waiting for the vesting system (smart contract) to go live on the blockchain. While there is trust in that person, it's important to remove human control entirely ‚Äî which is what vesting will achieve once deployed. After that point, not even the original creator can move or spend those tokens outside the vesting schedule.</p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="subtitle">üîπ What happens when the vesting contract goes live?</h2>
      <p>Once deployed, the 115 billion tokens will be transferred to a secure, decentralized program called a <strong>smart contract</strong> ‚Äî which acts like a <strong>virtual ATM machine</strong>. This ATM will only release tokens once per year, no earlier, no later. It's fully automatic, tamper-proof, and can't be changed or stopped. It's like programming a robot with one simple job and then throwing away the remote.</p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="subtitle">üîπ How are those 1 billion tokens used every year?</h2>
      <p>
        Each year, when 1 billion GERD tokens are released:<br>
        - <strong>500 million GERD</strong> are divided and sent to everyone who holds GERD tokens in their wallet.<br>
        - <strong>250 million GERD</strong> are used for staking rewards, giving bonuses to people who lock up their tokens.<br>
        - <strong>250 million GERD</strong> are sent to support liquidity ‚Äî but only if needed. If liquidity is already high, this amount is <strong>burned</strong> (destroyed) to reduce supply and support the token‚Äôs value.
      </p>
      <p>This structure supports long-term health, rewards active holders, and avoids inflation.</p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="subtitle">üîπ Will everyone get the same amount?</h2>
      <p>Yes, the 500 million tokens for holders are shared <strong>equally</strong> ‚Äî not based on how much GERD you hold. Every wallet that holds any amount of GERD will receive the same fixed amount during each yearly release. For example, if 1 million wallets are holding GERD at the time of the release, each one will receive 500 GERD. If only 100 wallets are holding GERD, each one gets 5 million GERD. So, the earlier you become a holder, the more you'll receive ‚Äî because there are fewer wallets to split the 500 million.</p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="subtitle">üîπ Can anyone stop or change this system later?</h2>
      <p>Absolutely not. Once the tokens are inside the vesting smart contract, they are <strong>locked forever</strong>. No person, organization, or developer can access them outside of the yearly schedule. This is the power of decentralized blockchain technology ‚Äî it removes human risk and guarantees that the rules are enforced automatically, forever.</p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="subtitle">üîπ Why is this good for the community?</h2>
      <p>This system removes the need to trust any individual. It guarantees fairness, ensures that no one can cheat or take more than their share, and makes sure that token rewards are distributed every year for over a century. It‚Äôs a long-term, transparent way to support the growth of the community, provide predictable rewards, and prevent surprises. This is about creating digital wealth that lasts across generations.</p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="subtitle">üîπ So what should I do now?</h2>
      <p>Just make sure you hold GERD tokens in your own wallet (not on an exchange) before each yearly release. If you‚Äôre holding at the right time, you‚Äôll automatically receive your share of the 500 million tokens for that year. No need to claim anything or pay extra ‚Äî it‚Äôs all handled by the smart contract. Easy, secure, and fair.</p>
