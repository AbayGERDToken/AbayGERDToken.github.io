      <h1 class="title">Abay GERD Token Vesting Strategy Announced: Reinforcing Transparency and Sustainable Growth</h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        The <strong>Abay GERD Token (GERD)</strong> introduces a transformative vesting strategy designed to enhance long-term value,
        promote stability, and build trust through full transparency. This development marks a major milestone in the token‚Äôs evolution.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Overview of the Vesting Plan</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to the milestone airdrop distributed to all existing wallet addresses on May 5, 2025, to commemorate its
        <strong>2-year anniversary</strong>, GERD Token has introduced a long-term vesting framework to further demonstrate its
        commitment to sustainability and ongoing community rewards.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        A total of <strong>115 billion tokens</strong> will be locked in a secure, immutable smart contract, with a scheduled release
        of <strong>1 billion tokens per year</strong> over the next 115 years. This approach ensures a consistent and predictable
        distribution model that incentivizes long-term holding and active participation.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The smart contract is fully autonomous and irreversible. Once deployed, its rules cannot be modified or bypassed‚Äîneither by
        the original developers nor any external party. The vesting schedule and token release conditions will be permanently embedded
        in the blockchain and remain verifiable by anyone at any time.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Key Details</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>115 Billion Tokens Will Be Locked:</strong> Secured in an irreversible smart contract on Binance Smart Chain (BSC).</li>
        <li><strong>Annual Release of 1 Billion Tokens:</strong> Starting April 23, 2026, 1 billion tokens will be released annually.</li>
        <li><strong>500 Million Airdropped to Holders:</strong> Distributed evenly to all active GERD holders‚Äîno action needed.</li>
        <li><strong>250 Million for Staking Rewards:</strong> For users who stake GERD tokens, encouraging engagement.</li>
        <li><strong>Up to 250 Million for Liquidity or Burn:</strong> Added to liquidity if under 500M; otherwise burned.</li>
        <li><strong>Publicly Verifiable:</strong> All activity is traceable and transparent on-chain.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Why It Matters</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Encourages long-term participation with annual rewards.</li>
        <li>Promotes sustainable and predictable growth.</li>
        <li>Aligns with a decentralized financial model for the GERD community.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>

      <h2 class="subtitle">A Community-Driven Digital Asset</h2>
      <p>
        GERD Token‚Äôs value comes from its community, not institutions. Its adoption and utility define its worth‚Äîlike Bitcoin, it‚Äôs a
        decentralized people-powered asset.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h2 class="subtitle">A Generational Asset</h2>
      <p>
        Designed to last over a century, GERD Token is a long-term digital inheritance. Early holders benefit most from the annual
        airdrop structure, and as the number of wallets increases, each share becomes smaller‚Äîrewarding early adopters significantly.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Looking Ahead</h2>
      <p>
        GERD Token continues to grow on principles of fairness, transparency, and generational wealth. Its vesting mechanism offers a
        rare chance to build digital legacy for years to come.
