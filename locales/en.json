      "q1": {
        "title": "Why do Ethiopia originated wallets receive 75,000 GERD while others get 10,000 GERD tokens?",
        "body": "The Abay GERD Token was created as a tribute to the people of Ethiopia who collectively funded and built the Grand Renaissance Dam without external aid. This project represents unity, self-determination, and national pride. As such, Ethiopia is at the heart of this initiative and receive the highest reward."
      },

        "title": "Why does the rest of the world receive 10,000 GERD?",
        "body": "Global participants are essential to the success of any decentralized project. We welcome and appreciate your support. The 10,000 GERD reward reflects both inclusivity and our commitment to keeping the token's value sustainable while prioritizing communities most directly connected to the project's origin."
      },
      "q3": {
        "title": "Isn't this unfair or discriminatory?",
        "body": "Not at all. This is mission-aligned distribution, not exclusion. Every user, regardless of region or background, is eligible to receive tokens and participate freely. The distribution structure ensures that those who contributed to building the foundation are recognized and empowered in proportion to their efforts."
      },
      "q4": {
        "title": "Will I still be able to trade or earn more GERD tokens?",
        "body": "Yes. GERD tokens will remain tradable for all users worldwide. Once 10,000 wallets have successfully claimed tokens and the token is listed on a centralized exchange (CEX), users will also be eligible to participate in future rewards, airdrops, and community-driven initiatives."

    "vesting": {

        "title": "What is \"vesting\" and why should I care?",
        "body": "Vesting is a way to release tokens in small, scheduled portions over time instead of giving them all out at once. For the GERD Token, vesting means exactly 1 billion tokens will be released every year for the next 115 years. This creates long-term stability and prevents large dumps on the market."
      },
      "q2": {
        "title": "Who controls the tokens right now?",
        "body": "As of now, 115 billion GERD tokens are still in a wallet controlled by a single human. They are waiting for the vesting system (smart contract) to go live on the blockchain. Once vesting is live, the tokens will be governed by the contract."
      },
      "q3": {
        "title": "What happens when the vesting contract goes live?",
        "body": "Once deployed, the tokens will be transferred to a secure, decentralized program called a smart contract — it will automatically release tokens once per year. It's tamper-proof and cannot be changed once deployed."

      "q4": {
        "title": "How are those 1 billion tokens used every year?",

        "title": "Will everyone get the same amount?",
        "body": "Yes, the 500 million tokens for holders are shared equally — not based on how much GERD you hold. Every wallet holding any amount of GERD will receive the same fixed amount during each yearly release."
      },
      "q6": {
        "title": "Can anyone stop or change this system later?",
        "body": "Absolutely not. Once the tokens are inside the vesting smart contract, they are locked and cannot be changed by anyone."
